# easy-music
An android easy-to-use music player for the elderly, only basic functionalities are kept.

# Why?
My grandma wants to listen to music but she couldn't use free music app from Google Play Store, since there's too many ads and they often come with advanced (= hard to use) features that she doens't need.

# How?
These are my golden rules to follow in this app
- Big text
- Hot/Warm color palette
- Vietnamese by default
- Simple (at most 2 taps for actions, idealy 1 tap)
- Not too sensitive (YES, this is not a mistake, since aging people often touch phone's screen accidentally, sometime they don't mean to change the song)

# Next?
This app was made in 2hrs including learning Android programming. So it's trash.
A lot of things to be improved, but atleast, it works
